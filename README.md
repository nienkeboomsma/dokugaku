# Uploading files

## Cover

When uploading manga, please note that the first image will be used as the cover image.

## Pre-mokuro'd manga

It might make more sense to run Mokuro on your host machine instead of leaving it to the mokuro container (on my own machine it's about 8 times as fast). In that case, check the 'already mokurod' checkbox and upload the JSON files along with the images.

## Texts with images

Please note that images inside of .md or .html files will be stripped during processing. This can be problematic if images are used for chapter titles (as they often are in Kindle books). In that case, be sure to manually replace the images with an appropriate text string before uploading the files.
